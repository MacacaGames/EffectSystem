# Introduction

The Effect System is a powerful numerical calculator based on EffectType. It offers high flexibility, manageable states, custom logic implementation, trigger conditions, and visual management. Effect System can handle various functionalities, such as:

- Increasing ATK by 50 points.
- Increasing HP by 10%.
- Increasing DEF by 5% for 50 seconds.
- Reducing a specified enemy's ATK by 100 points, usable every 30 seconds.
- Reducing the opponent's DEF by 50% when a successful block occurs.

The system uses tables to combine various buffs, debuffs, or special effects, with `EffectInfo` as the core unit, allowing for easy application across different projects. Engineers only need to implement the `EffectType` and register activation and deactivation timings.


### Features
- Adjust effects through Excel
- Combine different Effect using `EffectSubInfo`

# Installation

### Option 1: OpenUPM (Recommended)

```sh
openupm add com.macacagames.effectsystem
```

### Option 2: Unity Package Manager
Add the following to your project's manifest.json file:
```json
{
    "dependencies": {
        "com.macacagames.utility": "https://github.com/MacacaGames/MacacaUtility.git",
        "com.macacagames.effectsystem": "https://github.com/MacacaGames/EffectSystem.git"
    }
}
```

### Option 3: Git SubModule
Add the EffectSystem as a Git submodule:
```bash
git submodule add https://github.com/MacacaGames/EffectSystem.git Assets/MacacaEffectSystem
```
> Note: EffectSystem depends on MacacaUtility, so you also need to add MacacaUtility as a Git submodule:
```bash
git submodule add https://github.com/MacacaGames/MacacaUtility.git Assets/MacacaUtility
```
---

# Fundamentals

### EffectSystem

Before using the Effect System, you must first create an `EffectSystem` class, which will be responsible for managing the states and calculations of all effects.

After creating a new instance of EffectSystem, call `Init()` to complete the basic setup.

```csharp
var effectSystem = new EffectSystem();
effectSystem.Init();
```

In the Unity environment, EffectSystem uses the singleton pattern by default. After calling `Init()`, you can retrieve the instance using `EffectSystem.Instance`.

If you are on a platform outside of Unity, or if you prefer to manage the instance yourself, you can ignore `EffectSystem.Instance` and use your own dependency management solution to handle the `EffectSystem` instance.

### IEffectableObject

The `IEffectableObject` interface allows a C# object to have effects added or removed. Whether it's an enemy, a character, a card, or any other object you want to apply effects to, it should be made into an `IEffectableObject`.

```csharp
public interface IEffectableObject
{
    /// <summary>
    /// Gets the display name of the IEffectableObject.
    /// Not strictly required, but very helpful for debugging.
    /// </summary>
    /// <returns></returns>
    string GetDisplayName();

    /// <summary>
    /// Retrieves the parent Transform for the effect view based on the viewRoot.
    /// </summary>
    /// <param name="viewRoot"></param>
    /// <returns></returns>
    Transform GetEffectViewParent(string viewRoot);

    /// <summary>
    /// Determines whether this IEffectableObject accepts the application of the 
    /// provided info. This method should only include checks and should not perform 
    /// any operations on the effect.
    /// </summary>
    /// <param name="info"></param>
    /// <returns>Returns false if this IEffectableObject reject the effect request.</returns>
    bool ApprovedAddEffect(EffectInfo info);

    /// <summary>
    /// Triggered when an Effect Instance becomes active.
    /// </summary>
    /// <param name="info"></param>
    void OnEffectActive(EffectInfo info);

    /// <summary>
    /// Triggered when an Effect Instance becomes inactive.
    /// </summary>
    /// <param name="info"></param>
    void OnEffectDeactive(EffectInfo info);

    /// <summary>
    /// Determines if the object is still "alive". Effect can only be attached to a alive IEffectableObject.
    /// </summary>
    /// <returns></returns>
    bool IsAlive();

    /// <summary>
    /// Since the actual runtime values are maintained by the IEffectableObject, 
    /// implement the values needed for your game.
    /// For example, ATK_Current = ATK_Constant * ATK_Ratio.
    /// </summary>
    /// <param name="parameterKey"></param>
    /// <returns></returns>
    float GetRuntimeValue(string parameterKey);

    /// <summary>
    /// Destroys the IEffectableObject.
    /// </summary>
    void DestoryEffectableObject();
}
```



### Effect Instance

Objects generated at runtime that inherit from `EffectInstanceBase` are called effect instances.
Effect instance is created based on `EffectInfo`. Weâ€™ll talk about that later. For now, you can think of `EffectInfo` as a storage space for various parameters of the effect.

### Basic effect implementation

A basic effect can involve the addition or subtraction of a value. Therefore, simply declaring a class that inherits from `EffectInstanceBase` and adding a constructor will complete the implementation of an effect.

The Effect System uses reflection to find the class specified by the `EffectInfo` type. The search follows the naming convention of <mark style="background: yellow">Effect_{type}</mark>, so you must name your `EffectInstanceBase` implementation according to this format.

```csharp
//a basic implementation
public class Effect_ATK_Constant : EffectInstanceBase
{
    public Effect_ATK_Constant(EffectSystem effectSystem) : base(effectSystem)
    {
        
    }
}
```

Next, by calling `EffectSystem.AddEffect` and passing in the effect's owner and `EffectInfo`, you can create an effect instance and attach it to an IEffectableObject.

```csharp
// Define two effects with the same type
var effectAddAtkSmall = new EffectInfo{
    id = "AddAtkSmall",
    type = "ATK_Constant",
    value = 100,
    /// Other parameters are ignored in this example
};

IEffectableObject player;
//Get the EffectSystem using your dependency management solution
EffectSystem effectSystem;

effectSystem.AddEffect(target, effectAddAtkSmall);

var sumValue = effectSystem.GetEffectSum( player, "ATK_Constant");
// // sumValue is 100s
```

### Advanced effect implementation
If you need more than just simple addition or subtraction of values, you can override the variables and methods provided by `EffectInstanceBase`, and customize the behavior of the Effect. 

Example:
```csharp
// Create a new class that inherits from the EffectInstanceBase class
public class Effect_MyEffect : EffectInstanceBase
{
    public Effect_MyEffect(EffectSystem effectSystem) : base(effectSystem)
    {
    }
    /// <summary>If the effect value of this type for the owner exceeds the set value, the effect will not be applied.</summary>
    public override float maxEffectValue => 100;

    /// <summary>The upper and lower limits of the value obtained by this EffectType.</summary>
    public override (float min, float max) sumLimit => 100f;

    public Effect_MyEffect(EffectSystem effectSystem) : base(effectSystem)
    {
    }
    protected override void OnStart()
    {

    }
    public override void OnActive(EffectTriggerConditionInfo triggerConditionInfo)    
    {

    }
    public override void OnDeactive(EffectTriggerConditionInfo triggerConditionInfo)   
    {

    }
    public override void OnCooldownEnd()    
    {

    }
}

// For a trigger-based effect, you can inherit from the EffectTriggerBase class
public class Effect_Myffect : EffectTriggerBase
{ 
    public Effect_MyEffect(EffectSystem effectSystem) : base(effectSystem)
    {
    }

    // Execute immediately after OnActive().
    protected override void OnTrigger(EffectTriggerConditionInfo conditionInfo)
    {

    }
}
```


### EffectInfo
`EffectInfo` defines an effect by storing its settings but does not handle the runtime behavior.

| Field                    | Data Type                  | Description                                                                                                                                |
| ------------------------ | -------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |

| activeProbability        | float                      | The probability (0-1) of the effect being activated         |
| deactiveCondition        | string                     | The condition that deactivates the effect              |
| deactiveRequirementLists | string[]                   | The requirements for deactivating the effect                    |
| deactiveProbability      | float                      | The probability (0-1) of the effect being deactivated                |
| maintainTime             | float                      | The duration for which the effect remains active                        |
| cooldownTime             | float                      | The cooldown time in seconds before the effect can be activated again                                                         |
| logic                    | enum                       | Life cycle management preset logic, see [TriggerTransType](#triggertranstype) for more details      |
| triggerTransType         | enum                       | An enumeration for managing the logic when the effect is triggered more than once, see [EffectLifeCycleLogic](#effectlifecyclelogic) for detailss |
| tags                     | string[]                   | Tags are typically used for categorization and can be checked to achieve more complex effects.  |
| subInfoIds               | string[]                   | At runtime, subInfoIds are converted into effect instances, which are used to achieve more complex effects. Check the [SubInfo](###subinfo) section for more details.                         |
| viewInfoIds              | string[]                   | The IDs of the view data for the effect   |
| parameters               | Dictionary<string, string> | Parameters are designed as a string dictionary, allowing you to set custom variables and achieve more complex effects. |

### Condition  

`activeCondition` and `deactiveCondition` determines when an effect becomes active and when it deactivates.

| Field                    | Data Type | Description                                                      |
| ------------------------ | --------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------- |
| activeCondition          | string    | The condition that triggers the effect activation                           |
| deactiveCondition        | string    | The condition that triggers the effect deactivation                         |

Example:
```csharp
var effectAddAtkSmall = new EffectInfo{
    id = "AddAtkSmall",
    type = "ATK_Constant",
    activeCondition = "ConditionOnAttack"
};
EffectSystem effectSystem;
MyCharacter character = new MyCharacter();

effectSystem.AddRequestedEffects(target, effectAddAtkSmall); // first add call

class MyCharacter: IEffectableObject {
    void DoAttack(){
        // All Effect Instances on 'this' object with activeCondition == "ConditionOnAttack" will attempt to activate.
        effectSystem.EffectTriggerCondition("ConditionOnAttack", this);
    }
}
```

The system provides two default conditions, which it will attempt to execute when processing the effect's lifecycle:

- `ActiveCondition.OnEffectStart`

This active condition is fulfilled as soon as the effect is applied to an `IEffectableObject`, and it immediately triggers `OnActive()`.

- `DeactiveCondition.AfterActive`

This deactive condition is fulfilled once `OnActive()` has been executed, and it immediately triggers `OnDeactive()`.


### RequirementLists

`activeRequirementLists` and `deactiveRequirementLists` are used to add constraints to condition triggers. The condition will only be triggered if these constraints are met.


| Field                    | Data Type | Description                                                      |
| ------------------------ | --------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------- |
| activeRequirementLists   | string[]  | The qualifications required to activate the effect |
| deactiveRequirementLists | string[]  | The qualifications required to deactivate the effect            |

<br>

A requirement is defined by the `ConditionRequirement` class, and a `ConditionRequirement` is a check against a specific value.

Example:
```csharp
//This ConditionRequirement checks if the owner's HP is below 30%.
var conditionExample = new ConditionRequirement{
    id = "isLowHealth",
    conditionParameter= "HP_Ratio",
    requirementLogic= ConditionLogic.Less,
    conditionValue= 30,
    isCheckOwner= true,
};
```

To set a requirement, you first need to inject a method to query `ConditionRequirement`. Then, fill in the ID of ConditionRequirement in the `requirementLists` of `EffectInfo`. This way, the effect can find the corresponding `ConditionRequirement` at runtime.

```csharp
public class SkillSystem
{
    //prepare your activeRequirements data
    static List<ConditionRequirement> activeRequirements = new List<ConditionRequirement>();
    static List<ConditionRequirement> deactiveRequirements = new List<ConditionRequirement>();

    // register methods to get corresponding requirements
    void RegisterStaticMethods()
    {
        if (EffectInfo.GetActiveRequirementLists == null)
        {
            EffectInfo.GetActiveRequirementLists = (m) =>
            {
                return GetActiveRequirements(m);
            };
        }
        if (EffectInfo.GetDeactiveRequirementLists == null)
        {
            EffectInfo.GetDeactiveRequirementLists = (m) =>
            {
                return GetDeactiveRequirements(m);
            };
        }
    }

    // implement searching method 
    public List<ConditionRequirement> GetActiveRequirements(IEnumerable<string> ids)
    {
        return activeRequirements.Where(m => ids.Contains(m.id)).ToList();
    }
    public List<ConditionRequirement> GetDeactiveRequirements(IEnumerable<string> ids)
    {
        return deactiveRequirements.Where(m => ids.Contains(m.id)).ToList();
    }
}
```

### Probability 

Probability makes the effect trigger based on chance. `activeProbability` = 0.4 means that when the effect's `activeCondition` is triggered, there is a 40% chance that the effect will continue to execute `OnActive()`. 

| Field                    | Data Type | Description                                                      |
| ------------------------ | --------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------- |
| activeProbability        | float     | The probability (0-1) of the effect being activated         |
| deactiveProbability      | float     | The probability (0-1) of the effect being deactivated          |

When Probability is set to 0, the Effect System will skip the probability check.

### Time Management
Different games may use different time units. For example, action or RPG games may use seconds as the time unit, while turn-based games might use round as the time unit. You will need to implement the time calculation logic based on your project's needs.

For games based on seconds, you can typically update the timer in Update, with delta being `Time.deltaTime`
```csharp
void Update(){
    EffectSystem.Instance.TickEffectTimer(EffectSystemScriptableBuiltIn.TimerTickerId.Default ,Time.deltaTime);
}
```

For round-based games, update the timer in the callback for each round, with delta possibly being 1 (round)
```csharp
IEnumerator Round(){
    while(true){
         EffectSystem.Instance.TickEffectTimer(1);
        yield return new WaitForNextRound();
    }
}
```

#### MaintainTime
Effect System provides a method to manage the time-based lifecycle of an effect. Use the maintainTime field to define how long an effect should remain active. If `maintainTime` is greater than 0, the effect will follow a time-based lifecycle. You can use [TriggerTransType](#triggertranstype) and [EffectLifeCycleLogic](#effectlifecyclelogic) to control more specific behaviors. On the other hand, if maintainTime is 0, the effect's lifecycle will not be affected by time.

> The unit of "Time" is defined by the project, such as seconds, actions, or rounds. In the example below, we assume the unit of time is seconds.

Example:
```csharp
var effectAddAtkSmall = new EffectInfo{
    id = "AddAtkSmall",
    type = "ATK_Constant",
    value = 100,
    maintainTime = 0, // No time-based lifecycle
    /// Other parameters are ignored in this example
};

var effectAddAtkMedium = new EffectInfo{
    id = "AddAtkMedium",
    type = "ATK_Constant",
    value = 200,
    maintainTime = 10, // 10-second duration
    /// Other parameters are ignored in this example
};

EffectSystem effectSystem;
IEffectableObject target;

effectSystem.AddRequestedEffects(target, effectAddAtkSmall);
effectSystem.AddRequestedEffects(target, effectAddAtkMedium);


var result = effectSystem.GetEffectSum( target, "ATK_Constant");
// result is 300 

//wait 10 seconds
await Task.Delay(TimeSpan.FromSeconds(10));

var result = effectSystem.GetEffectSum( target, "ATK_Constant");
// result is 100 
```

#### CooldownTime
An Effect can be activated and deactivated freely before being recycled. `CooldownTime` is used to restrict how long the Effect cannot be reactivated after it has been deactivated.
It also uses [TriggerTransType](#triggertranstype) and [EffectLifeCycleLogic](#effectlifecyclelogic) to control more detailed behaviors.

Example:
```csharp
var effectAddAtkSmall = new EffectInfo{
    id = "HealSelfSmall",
    type = "HealSelf",
    value = 100,
    maintainTime = 5,
    cooldownTime = 10, // 10-second cooldown
    activeCondition = "ConditionOnAttack",
    deactiveCondition = "AfterActive", //AfterActive is a built-in condition. The effect will deactivate immediately after OnActive() is triggered.

    /// Other parameters are ignored in this example
};

// Make a IEffectableObject
class MyCharacter: IEffectableObject {
    public void DoAttack(){
        effectSystem.EffectTriggerCondition("ConditionOnAttack", this);
    }
}

//Make a HealSelf effect 
class Effect_HealSelf : EffectInstanceBase
{
    public Effect_HealSelf(EffectSystem effectSystem) : base(effectSystem)
    {
    }

     public override void OnActive(EffectTriggerConditionInfo condidionInfo)
    {
        Debug.Log("Heal Self Implementation")
    }
}

EffectSystem effectSystem;
MyCharacter character = new MyCharacter();

//apply effect
effectSystem.AddRequestedEffects(character, effectAddAtkSmall); 

// Trigger HealSelf succeeded. Deactive immediately and start cooldown timer
character.DoAttack();

await Task.Delay(TimeSpan.FromSeconds(5));

// Trigger HealSelf failed. Because effect is still in cooldown 
character.DoAttack();

await Task.Delay(TimeSpan.FromSeconds(5));

// Trigger HealSelf succeeded.
character.DoAttack();

```

### Pre-define Enums

#### TriggerTransType

If the Effect is already active and `OnActive()` is triggered again, `TriggerTransType` can determine how the Effect should be handled:

 | Field      | Data Description              |
 | ---------- | ----------------------------- |
 | SkipNewOne | Ignore the repeated trigger request            |
 | CutOldOne  | Call `OnDeactive()` first, then immediately call `OnActive()`. |



#### EffectLifeCycleLogic

`EffectLifeCycleLogic` provides some common lifecycle logic to reduce the hassle of creating Effects.

 | Field                    | Data Description                            |
 | ------------------------ | ------------------------------------------- |
 | None                     | Do nothing                                  |
 | OnlyActiveOnce           | The effect will only activate once and will be recycled afterward  |
 | ReactiveAfterCooldownEnd | automatically activate after the cooldown time ends |



### Manipulating Effect

The Effect System provides various methods for adding, removing, and querying effects.
Below are some commonly used methods.

| Method                                      | Description                                                                              |
| ------------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `AddRequestedEffects`                       | Adds effects to an `IEffectableObject`. In other words, create an effect instance owned by the `IEffectableObject`. EffectSystem will check `ApprovedAddEffect()` of the `IEffectableObject` before adding. |
| `RemoveEffectByTag`                         | Removes all EffectInstances from an IEffectableObject by their tags.                     |
| `RemoveEffectsByType`                       | Removes all EffectInstances from an IEffectableObject by their type.               |
| `GetEffectSum`                              | Gets the total value of all effects of the specified type on an IEffectableObject.        |
| `GetEffectsByType`                          | Retrieves a list of EffectInstances on an IEffectableObject based on their type.         |


```csharp
// Define two effects with the same type
var effectAddAtkSmall = new EffectInfo{
    id = "AddAtkSmall",
    type = "ATK_Constant",
    value = 100,
    /// Other parameters are ignored in this example
};
var effectAddAtkMedium = new EffectInfo{
    id = "AddAtkMedium",
    type = "ATK_Constant",
    value = 200,
    /// Other parameters are ignored in this example
};

public class Effect_ATK_Constant: EffectInstanceBase
{
    public Effect_ATK_Constant(EffectSystem effectSystem) : base(effectSystem)
    {
    }
}

IEffectableObject target;
//Get the EffectSystem using your dependency management solution
EffectSystem effectSystem;

effectSystem.AddRequestedEffect(target, effectAddAtkSmall);
effectSystem.AddRequestedEffect(target, effectAddAtkMedium);

/* or
effectSystem.AddRequestedEffects(
    target, new []{
        effectAddAtkSmall,
        effectAddAtkMedium
    }   
);
*/

var sumValue = effectSystem.GetEffectSum( target, "ATK_Constant");
// sumValue is 300 
var effects = effectSystem.GetEffectsByType(target, "ATK_Constant");
// effects.count = 2
```

![](Img~/lifecycle.png)


#### Runtime Value
Runtime value is a user-defined value, useful for projects that require complex value calculations involving multiple effect types.


See the follow example:
```csharp
var effectAddAtkSmall = new EffectInfo{
    id = "AddAtkSmall",
    type = "ATK_Constant",
    value = 100,
    /// Other parameters are ignored in this example
};

var effectAddAtkMedium = new EffectInfo{
    id = "AddAtkMedium",
    type = "ATK_Constant",
    value = 200,
    /// Other parameters are ignored in this example
};

var effectAddAtkSmall_Ratio = new EffectInfo{
    id = "AddAtkSmall_Ratio",
    type = "ATK_Ratio",
    value = 0.05,
    /// Other parameters are ignored in this example
};

var effectAddAtkMedium_Ratio = new EffectInfo{
    id = "AddAtkMedium_Ratio",
    type = "ATK_Ratio",
    value = 0.08,
    /// Other parameters are ignored in this example
};

EffectSystem effectSystem;
IEffectableObject target = new MyCharacter();

effectSystem.AddRequestedEffect(target, effectAddAtkSmall);

effectSystem.AddRequestedEffect(target, effectAddAtkSmall_Ratio);
effectSystem.AddRequestedEffect(target, effectAddAtkMedium_Ratio);

public class MyCharcter : IEffectableObject{

    // Use IEffectableObject.GetRuntimeValue(string) to get the user-defined runtime value
    public float GetRuntimeValue(string parameterKey){
        switch(parameterKey){
            case "CurrentATK":

### Remove or Clean Effect

The system will not automatically recycle the effect instance, so please remember to actively recycle it when the effect is no longer needed.

| Method                                      | Description                                                                              |
| ------------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `CleanEffectableObject`                       | Removes all EffectInstances from an IEffectableObject.               |
| `RemoveEffectByTag`                         | Removes all EffectInstances from an IEffectableObject by their tags.                     |
| `RemoveEffectsByType`                       | Removes all EffectInstances from an IEffectableObject by their type.               |

In most cases, simply calling `CleanEffectableObject` on the `IEffectableObject` in play at the end of a game is sufficient.

```csharp

void OnGameEnd()
{
    var effectables = GetEffectablesOnField();
    foreach(var obj in effectables)
    {
        effectSystem.CleanEffectableObject(obj);
    }
}

List<IEffectableObject> GetEffectablesOnField()
{
    //Get your IEffectables
}

```

### SubInfo

SubInfo is an abbreviation for a `EffectInfo` under another `EffectInfo`. It's a design used to allow `EffectInfo` to carry additional `EffectInfo`, and can be applied to effects that rely on other effects. For example, when `OnActive` is triggered, it applies two effects to the owner.

To enable `EffectInfo` to find SubInfo, you need to first fill in all SubInfo IDs in `subInfoIds`. Then, register an event to look up SubInfo, allowing the Effect System to convert the IDs into actual `EffectInfo` instances at runtime.

```csharp
public class SkillSystem
{
    //prepare your effects data
    static List<EffectInfo> effects = new List<EffectInfo>();

    // register methods to get EffectInfo
    void RegisterStaticMethods()
    {
        EffectDataProvider.SetEffectInfoDelegate(GetEffectByIds);
    }

    // implement searching method 
    static List<EffectInfo> GetEffectByIds(List<string> effectIds)
    {
        if (effects == null || effects.Count < 1)
        {
            throw new Exception("Please complete fetch effect first");
        }
        return effects.Where(m => effectIds.Contains(m.id)).ToList();
    }
}
```

Then, you can access subInfos in EffectInstanceBase.

```csharp
//Attach subInfos to self when triggered
public class Effect_Trigger_Attach : EffectTriggerBase
{
    public Effect_Trigger_Attach(EffectSystem effectSystem) : base(effectSystem)
    {
    }

    protected override void OnTrigger(EffectTriggerConditionInfo conditionInfo)
    {
        effectSystem.AddRequestedEffects(owner, info.subInfos);
    }

}
```
